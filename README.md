# neighborhood-map-reactnd

A neighborhood-map react app of Japan's Kyoto and Nara cities that allows you to check out my top favourite places and discover information 
about them by clicking on the markers in the map. 

# Leaflet API 

The map was initialized with the 'leaflet API' by installing the 'React-Leaflet' library. Also, Mapbox was used for creating the tile layer
of the map. Installation and setup was possible thanks to Leaflet's Quick Start Guide: https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/ and 
React-Leaflet library's site: https://react-leaflet.js.org/en/
